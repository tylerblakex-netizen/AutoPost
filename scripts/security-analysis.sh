echo "========================================================"
echo

echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  SECURITY ISSUE DEMONSTRATION:"
echo "The following Base64 patterns from PR #35 can be easily decoded:"
echo

# Demonstrate the security issue
echo "Pattern 1: NVd4cDA1TjhKS003TVZDUjFXVzE="
echo "Decodes to: $(echo NVd4cDA1TjhKS003TVZDUjFXVzE= | base64 -d)"
echo

echo "Pattern 2: dHVmVmtRdkk0Y3l4dmR0T2Q2MllOYTNR"
echo "Decodes to: $(echo dHVmVmtRdkk0Y3l4dmR0T2Q2MllOYTNR | base64 -d)"
echo

echo "üö® RISK: These original token values are now exposed in the CI workflow!"
echo

echo "‚úÖ SECURE ALTERNATIVES:"
echo "1. Remove custom token verification entirely (recommended)"
echo "   - Gitleaks already provides comprehensive secret detection"
echo "   - No need for duplicate checking with exposed patterns"
echo

echo "2. Use SHA256 hashes if verification is absolutely necessary:"
TOKEN1="5Wxp05N8JKM7MVCR1WW1"
TOKEN2="tufVkQvI4cyxvdtOd62YNa3Q"
echo "   - Token 1 hash: $(echo -n "$TOKEN1" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1)"
echo "   - Token 2 hash: $(echo -n "$TOKEN2" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1)"
echo "   (These hashes cannot be reversed to reveal the original tokens)"
echo

echo "3. Use environment variables for patterns (still not ideal):"
echo "   - Store patterns in GitHub Secrets"
echo "   - Reference via \${{ secrets.PATTERN_HASH }}"
echo

echo "üìã RECOMMENDATION:"
echo "Since gitleaks is already configured for secret detection,"
echo "remove the custom Base64 pattern verification entirely."
echo "This eliminates the security risk while maintaining protection."
